# Maximilians diary about movies, operas, books, concerts

A data analysis about my consumption of movies, operas, books and concerts. 


### Installation
The jupyter notebook is based on Python 3.7 and relies mainly on pandas, numpy and datetime for the data preparation. For plotting and visualizing I used mainly Seaborn and Altair. 


### Project motivation
In 2016, I started to write down every movie I saw, with who, where,the category and a my own rating. I also added movies and operas that I remembered from the past years, so my diary has now over 600 entries since 2002. 

Learning Python, I needed a "passion project" so I started to visualize my consumption of movies and operas. This way, I have learned a lot about pandas and seaborn. 


### About this version
As I am also analyzing whith whom I watch which movie, I excluded this information and these plots from the "public" version. However I am working on a dictionary to give my friends some nice pseudonyms. 

In the meantime, I just would like to show you some of my results, maybe you find them interesting and have ideas about their future development. 


### Ideas 
I am currently working on an implementation of IMDBPY to get more information about my movies from IMDB, work out a movie recomendation system and compare my own rating with IMDB's rating.

### How to interact
Every contribution or idea is welcome.
